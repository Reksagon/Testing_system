# Testing_system
 Implement a fully functional testing system.
One of the first tasks, do not judge strictly, I had fun as I could :)

The system must implement 2 modes:
■ Administrator;
■ Tested.
Description of the operating mode for the test subject (hereinafter guests)
To log in, the guest must register. This procedure is performed once, with subsequent logins in the system, accessible by login
and password.
At registration it is necessary to specify the full name, the home address, phone.
It is important that logins for users are unique.
After entering the guest the opportunity to get the opportunity to view their previous test results, to give a new test.
Testing can be performed on different categories of knowledge.
Example:
Mathematics (section) -> Discrete mathematics (specific test);
 -> Mathematical analysis (specific test).
Physics (section) -> Quantum physics (specific test);
 -> Mechanics (specific test).
After passing the test, the guest sees the test result, the number is correct
relevant questions, the percentage of correct answers and the score obtained.
The student has the opportunity to pre-test and continue it then,
when it is convenient for him.
Evaluation of the required conduct on the basis of a 12-point system tied
to the number of test questions.
Guests' passwords and logins are stored in encrypted form.
Description of the operating mode for the Administrator (hereinafter the administrator)
There can be only one administrator in the system, the login and password of the administrator are set
when you first enter the program.
In the future, the password and login can be changed (if this option is available
only admin).
The password and login must be stored only in encrypted form.
When working with systematic administration there are the following possibilities:
• User management - creating, deleting, modifying users.
• View statistics - view test results in general
by categories, by specific tests, by specific users.
The results of viewing statistics can be displayed in a file.
• Test management - the administrator has the ability to add categories, tests, questions to tests, ask correct and incorrect answers, import and export categories and tests from
questions from the file (and in the file).
